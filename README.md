# OMOP CDM Data Validator & Dashboard

This project is a **Python-based application** designed to validate and visualize the data quality of a dataset formatted to the **OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) v5.4**. It is built to help researchers and data engineers ensure their data is clean and compliant before it is used for analysis.

## Key Features & Functionalities

- **Schema-Driven Validation**  
  The core of the application is a custom validation script that uses a YAML-based schema to define and enforce rules. This schema is programmatically derived from the official OMOP CDM v5.4 DDL, ensuring accuracy and comprehensive coverage of all tables and columns.

- **Data Integrity Checks**  
  The tool performs a wide range of checks to identify common data quality issues, including:
  - Missing Columns
  - Data Type Mismatches
  - Required Field Validation
  - Primary Key Uniqueness
  - Foreign Key Constraints

- **Interactive Web Dashboard**  
  - **File Upload**: Users can easily upload their OMOP CDM CSV files.  
  - **Real-time Reporting**: After validation, a live report is generated on the dashboard, providing a clear summary of all errors found, categorized by table and type.

- **Scalable Design**  
  By separating the validation logic from the schema configuration, the application can be easily updated or extended to support new versions of the OMOP CDM or additional data quality rules.
